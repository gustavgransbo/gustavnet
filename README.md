# GustavNet
This is a small deep learning framework implemented in numpy.
The exercise was inspired by Joel Grus's [livecoding session](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o64FV-ez6Gw) where he did the same thing.
My hope is to refresh and improve some of my knowledge about basic neural nets, backpropagation and optimizers.

# Layout
I will follow the same layout as Joel did, which  is to divide the package into X sub-packages:
1. Tensor
2. Layer
3. Loss
4. NeuralNet
5. Optimizer
6. DataLoader
